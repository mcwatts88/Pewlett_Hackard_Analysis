# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Project

Pewlett Hackard is facing a large number of upcoming retirements of current employees. In order to mitigate this loss of talent from the workforce the company has decided to implement a mentorship program between the employees approaching retirement and employees pick to replace the roles that will soon be empty. The objective of this project was to get a list of employees that will be approaching retirement along with their current title and a mentorship eligibility list for current employees.

## Results

## Summary

There are two questions asked of this data analysis:

* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

This can be determined by using the below query

* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are enough mentors in most of the departments to cover the "silver tsunami." There are only 2 managers that are able to provide mentoring. This is probably not sufficient for a mentorship program.
